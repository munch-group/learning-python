The repository, with its files and folders, serves as a scaffold for your project, with placeholder files to get you started.\nDuring the project, you will populate it with your code, analysis notebooks, and documentation reporting your work and use Git to track this development. This way your project will end up documented by a set of pages like these.",

Such a plan is tentative and will change along the way when you find such changes are meaningful or necessary.\nAn excellent way to do this is to use the GitHub Project feature on our group GitHub account.",
