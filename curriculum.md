# Curriculum

The curriculum for programming is a set of lecture notes that I have written myself to fit this course best.

- Lecture notes

Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing field, and so textbooks often have parts that are out of date. So in this course, the curriculum for bioinformatics is put together from several sources. We use the best excerpts from the textbooks Understanding Bioinformatics by Jeremy Baum and Marketa J. Zvelebil, Biological Sequence analysis by Richard Durbin et al., and Exploring Bioinformatics by Caroline St. Clair and Jonathan E. Visick. I have collected the sections from each textbook in separate compendia. You will also be reading short up-to-date publications on selected topics in bioinformatics. 

Here you can find all the curriculum we will to through at the lectures. You can see what you need to read to prepare for each lecture in the weekly notes. In the weekly note you can also find any curriculum related to the exercises.

Compendia you can download here:

- Compendium of selections from Understanding Bioinformatics
- Compendium of selections from Biological Sequence Analysis
- Compendium of selections from Exploring Bioinformatics
